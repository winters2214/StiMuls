### A modest JavaScript framework that works with the HTML you already have

Stimulus is a JavaScript framework with modest ambitions. It doesn't not seek to take over your entire front end, and it's barely concerned with rendering HTML at all. It's designed to stimulate the HTML you're already generating on the server side with just enough behavior to make it sparkle. It pairs beautifully with Turbolinks to provide a complete solution for fast, compelling applications with a minimal of intervention and effort.

How does it work? Sprinkle your HTML with magic controller, target, and action attributes:

```html
<div data-controller="hello">
  <input data-target="hello.name" type="text">
  <button data-action="click->hello#greet">Greet</button>
</div>
```

Then write a compatible controller. Stimulus brings it to life automatically:

```js
// hello_controller.js
import { Controller } from "stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.targets.find("name")}!`)
  }
}
```

Stimulus continuously watches the page, kicking in as soon as magic attributes appear or disappear. Any update to the DOM, whether from a Turbolinks page change or a partial fetch, is processed and connected. Stimulus manages the whole lifecycle.

You can write your first controller in five minutes by following along in [The Stimulus Handbook](handbook/README.md).

## Installing Stimulus

Stimulus integrates with the [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) asset packager to automatically load controller files from a folder in your app.

You can use Stimulus with other asset packaging systems, too. And if you prefer no build step at all, just drop a `<script>` tag on the page and get right down to business.

See the [Installation Guide](INSTALLING.md) for detailed instructions.
