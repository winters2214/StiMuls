# 1â€‚Introduction

* Why another framework?
* New take on an old idea
* Stimulus embraces, rather than abstracts away, the DOM
* Encourages you to use the DOM as application state
* Provides separation of concerns
* Lays bare the wiring - you can see the annotations and know what will happen
* Encourages small, reusable behaviors
* Allows you to load and render HTML any way you want
